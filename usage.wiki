Currently, we don't have any API for accessing database. Instead, you can use GitHub Raw links to access our data.

For machine-readable index listing, please to use [[list.json]] (recommended) or [[list.yaml]].

We currently provide data in HJSON, JSON, YAML, and XML file at the moment. Thus, all data were standardized by our [[schemas/entry.json|JSON Schema for entry]].
